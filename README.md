# Data cleaning with SQL

This analysis provided an opportunity for me to explore global data on confirmed Covid 19 deaths and Vaccinations. 
About the Data:
The analysis represents data collected and presented in GitHub regarding the status of Covid and how it affects the world population. There were multiple datasets to analyze but I chose two. The data collected was from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 05, 2022, the date of data upload. At current time, these datasets are continually being updated.
